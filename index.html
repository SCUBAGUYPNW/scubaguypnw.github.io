    <h1>Who am I, and who do I want to be.</h1>
    <div class="life-story">
      <p>Sci-Fi fan, technology enthusiast, SCUBA diver, husband. Working to get out of what I call the entry level rut. Have a resume with pages of experience but no certificates or degrees to go with it. Currently enrolled in classes at Code Fellows to change all that. I have wanted to be a coder for all of my adult life. I joined the Army as a Computer Programmer in 1992. I didn't do a lot of coding though, mostly provided support for an application developed by the team I worked for. Served in the army for about seven years and then entered into employment in the private sector.  After seven years in the private sector I knew I could do more with my life and started taking classes at a Community College with the goal of degree in Computer Engineering. I was two years in and hadn't taken any classes that had to do with Computer Engineering or coding when I was deployed to Iraq. After returning home I tried to go back to classes at the Community College but my drive to continue just wasn't there. Found out about Code Fellows and knew this was what I was looking for.</p>
